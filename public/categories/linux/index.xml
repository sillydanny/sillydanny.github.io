      <description>Introduction Rsync is an open-source application that provides fast incremental or mirror backup by leveraging built-in data deduplication algorithms. It is included in almost all Linux distributions.
Features Can update whole directory trees and filesystems Optionally preserves symbolic links, hard links, file ownership, permissions, devices and times Requires no special privileges to install Internal pipelining reduces latency for multiple files Can use rsh, ssh or direct sockets as the transport Supports anonymous rsync which is ideal for mirroring Basic Use 1 rsync -option source/ destination/ Option Description -v Verbose mode, outputs detailed information -r Recurse into directories -a Archive mode (-rlptgoD, no -A, -X, -U, -N, -H) -h Output numbers in a human-readable format -z Use compression to transfer data -e Specify the remote shell to use -P Same as &amp;ndash;partial &amp;ndash;progress -W Copy files whole (without delta-xfer algorithm) &amp;ndash;progress Show progress during transfer &amp;ndash;delete Delete extraneous files from destination directories &amp;ndash;remove-source-files Sender removes synchronized files (non-dir) &amp;ndash;exclude=PATTERN Exclude files matching PATTERN &amp;ndash;include=PATTERN Don&amp;rsquo;t exclude files matching PATTERN &amp;ndash;copy-as=USER[:GROUP] Specify user and optional group for the copy &amp;ndash;chmod=CHMOD Affect file and/or directory permissions Samples 1 rsync -avh /home/user/data/ /mnt/backup Copy /home/user/data/ (as source directory) to /mnt/backup (as destination directory), using the options -avh.</description>

      <title>Setting a static IP address in Linux</title>
      <link>https://www.kingtam.tk/posts/linux-static-ip/</link>

      <guid>https://www.kingtam.tk/posts/linux-static-ip/</guid>
      <description>Introduction: Usually, IP addresses are dynamically assigned by the router&amp;rsquo;s DHCP server on most network devices. But using a static IP address on the server makes the provided services more stable. If the DHCP server is not working, it will affect the computers in the local area network to obtain IP addresses, thereby affecting access to services, while servers with static IP addresses are not affected, so static IP is also necessary (on devices providing services).</description>

      <description>Configuring VLANs on a Host for Proxmox VE In today&amp;rsquo;s increasingly complex networking environments, Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) have become a crucial tool for managing network traffic and ensuring optimal performance.
This blog post provides a step-by-step guide on configuring VLANs on a host for Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE), a popular open-source virtualization platform.
Why use VLANs with Proxmox VE? VLANs allow you to segregate network traffic into isolated broadcast domains, improving security and reducing network congestion.</description>

      <description>Installing CUPS on PVE&amp;rsquo;s LXC Container System Introduction: At home, I use a Canon LBP6030 USB printer connected to a Padavan system on a router (Youku1) to enable wireless printing. However, wireless printing can only be achieved on the Windows platform, and on systems such as macOS and IOS from Apple, it cannot be achieved, causing some inconvenience.
I came across this post on SMZDM N1刷armbian變身打印服務器, which can install CUPS software as a printer server system, and thus the following content was recorded.</description>
